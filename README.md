### Contact

- display phone numbers, scroll upward and downward.
- call to someone.

### Gallery
- select photos from other gallery applications(ex : basic gallery app, google photo).
- share photo to someone.

### Restaurant Recommendation
- recommend a good restaurant near you with a Google Places rating of 3.5/5 or higher.

- it's available only `three times a day` so that you can choose a restaurant without hesitation. Think that the restaurant you choose is your destiny :smirk:
